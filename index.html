    <h3>Welcome!</h3>

    <p>
      I am a PhD student in Social and Political Science at Bocconi University in Milan, where my research focuses on political behaviour, political psychology, and democratic processes. I study how emotions, identities, and contextual factors shape citizens’ attitudes and participation, using experimental and mixed methods. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My research agenda centers on emotions, cognition, and populism, as I am developing a novel theory of the “populist mind.” I have presented my work at international conferences and interdisciplinary workshops spanning political science and social psychology. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Alongside my research, I work at Bocconi as a teaching assistant and lecturer for both undergraduate and master’s-level courses in political science, and I co-organize an Early Career Researcher seminar series and professional development roundtables. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I also serve as Editorial Manager for the
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/geui20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of European Integration</a> and regularly review academic articles for PLOS ONE and Frontiers in Psychology.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      I hold two master’s degrees in International Relations (Université libre de Bruxelles) and Public Policy (Luiss University Rome).
